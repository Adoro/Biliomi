    # The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the country Biliomi is active in.
    # This is important for some integrations, to be able to comply with locational laws.

  database:
    # Use a file-based H2 database.
    # If set to true, Biliomi will use a local H2 database for data storage. Other database settings will be ignored.
    # If set to false, Biliomi will try and use the connection info below to connect to a MySQL database.
    # Note: H2 is not recommended for production use as it is VERY slow as opposed to a MySQL server.
    useH2Database: true
    # The adress of the MySQL database to connect to.

    # The database name to use (Must be created on the MySQL server before installation).
